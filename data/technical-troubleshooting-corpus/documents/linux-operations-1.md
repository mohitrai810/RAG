# Linux Systems Runbook - Volume 1

This original training corpus contains operational troubleshooting procedures for linux. It is designed for retrieval evaluation, not as a substitute for vendor documentation or a production change-management process.

## Disk full but du looks small

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-001

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that df reports a full filesystem while visible files use much less space. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, a deleted file remains open by a running process. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare df and du and run lsof for deleted files. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to restart or signal the owning process so the open file descriptor is released. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring a deleted file remains open by a running process to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it. Check whether the same symptom occurs where the suspected condition is absent, and whether the condition exists on healthy instances. If those comparisons disagree with the hypothesis, return to evidence collection. In particular, do not confuse correlation after a deployment with causation. The decisive observation for KB-LINUX-001 should connect the reported behavior - df reports a full filesystem while visible files use much less space - to the specific diagnostic signals listed above.

### Evidence package for escalation

If the incident cannot be resolved locally, prepare a compact escalation package. Include the UTC time window, software version, topology, sanitized configuration, the exact failing operation, and the output gathered when you compare df and du and run lsof for deleted files. Include what changed recently and which proposed causes were ruled out. Do not include passwords, tokens, customer payloads, or an unrestricted diagnostic archive. A good escalation lets another engineer test the same hypothesis without repeating discovery from the beginning.

### Operational safety notes

Avoid destructive cleanup, broad permission changes, unbounded retries, and emergency capacity changes without a rollback point. When the recommended action is to restart or signal the owning process so the open file descriptor is released, stage it on one instance or a controlled environment when possible. Measure the relevant success signal before and after the change. If production impact requires immediate mitigation, separate the temporary mitigation from the permanent correction and create a follow-up item with an owner and deadline.

### Prevention

Add an alert for the earliest measurable precursor, document the capacity or configuration boundary, and create a regression test when the failure can be reproduced safely. The durable lesson for KB-LINUX-001 is to connect a precise symptom to evidence before changing production state.

## High load with low CPU

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-002

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that load average is high while CPU utilization remains modest. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, many tasks are blocked in uninterruptible I/O wait. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect process states, iostat latency, and pressure stall information. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to resolve the slow storage or network filesystem instead of adding CPU. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring many tasks are blocked in uninterruptible I/O wait to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## Process killed without application error

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-003

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that the service disappears and its logs end abruptly. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the kernel OOM killer terminated it. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect kernel logs and cgroup memory events. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to reduce peak memory, fix leaks, and configure realistic memory limits. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

## Too many open files

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-004

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that connections fail with EMFILE or too many open files. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the process reached its file descriptor limit or leaked descriptors. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect /proc PID fd count and soft and hard limits. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to close descriptors correctly and raise limits only after capacity analysis. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks
