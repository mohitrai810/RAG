# Linux Systems Runbook - Volume 2

This original training corpus contains operational troubleshooting procedures for linux. It is designed for retrieval evaluation, not as a substitute for vendor documentation or a production change-management process.

## Zombie processes accumulate

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-005

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that process listings show many tasks in Z state. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the parent process does not reap terminated children. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, identify parent PIDs and inspect wait handling. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to fix the supervisor or parent to call wait and use a proper init process in containers. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring the parent process does not reap terminated children to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it. Check whether the same symptom occurs where the suspected condition is absent, and whether the condition exists on healthy instances. If those comparisons disagree with the hypothesis, return to evidence collection. In particular, do not confuse correlation after a deployment with causation. The decisive observation for KB-LINUX-005 should connect the reported behavior - process listings show many tasks in Z state - to the specific diagnostic signals listed above.

### Evidence package for escalation

If the incident cannot be resolved locally, prepare a compact escalation package. Include the UTC time window, software version, topology, sanitized configuration, the exact failing operation, and the output gathered when you identify parent PIDs and inspect wait handling. Include what changed recently and which proposed causes were ruled out. Do not include passwords, tokens, customer payloads, or an unrestricted diagnostic archive. A good escalation lets another engineer test the same hypothesis without repeating discovery from the beginning.

### Operational safety notes

Avoid destructive cleanup, broad permission changes, unbounded retries, and emergency capacity changes without a rollback point. When the recommended action is to fix the supervisor or parent to call wait and use a proper init process in containers, stage it on one instance or a controlled environment when possible. Measure the relevant success signal before and after the change. If production impact requires immediate mitigation, separate the temporary mitigation from the permanent correction and create a follow-up item with an owner and deadline.

### Prevention

Add an alert for the earliest measurable precursor, document the capacity or configuration boundary, and create a regression test when the failure can be reproduced safely. The durable lesson for KB-LINUX-005 is to connect a precise symptom to evidence before changing production state.

## Service works manually but not in systemd

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-006

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that a command succeeds in a shell but fails as a unit. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the service has a different user, working directory, environment, or PATH. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect systemctl status, journal output, and the effective unit configuration. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to declare absolute paths, environment, user, and working directory explicitly. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring the service has a different user, working directory, environment, or PATH to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## DNS intermittently slow

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-007

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that requests pause before connecting although destination servers are healthy. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, resolver timeouts, search domains, or unreachable name servers delay lookup. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, time getent and dig queries and inspect resolv.conf. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to repair resolver configuration and remove unreachable name servers. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

## Port already in use

Evidence ID: KB-LINUX-008

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that service startup fails with address already in use. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, another process or an old instance owns the listening socket. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect ss or lsof for the exact address and port. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to stop the unintended owner or configure a deliberate alternate port. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.
