# PostgreSQL Operations Runbook - Volume 2

This original training corpus contains operational troubleshooting procedures for postgresql. It is designed for retrieval evaluation, not as a substitute for vendor documentation or a production change-management process.

## Index bloat after heavy updates

Evidence ID: KB-POSTGRESQL-005

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that indexes consume far more space and scans become slower. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, updates and deletes leave dead index entries faster than maintenance removes them. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare relation sizes, dead tuples, and autovacuum history. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to tune autovacuum and rebuild the affected index with a low-lock strategy. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring updates and deletes leave dead index entries faster than maintenance removes them to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it. Check whether the same symptom occurs where the suspected condition is absent, and whether the condition exists on healthy instances. If those comparisons disagree with the hypothesis, return to evidence collection. In particular, do not confuse correlation after a deployment with causation. The decisive observation for KB-POSTGRESQL-005 should connect the reported behavior - indexes consume far more space and scans become slower - to the specific diagnostic signals listed above.

### Evidence package for escalation

If the incident cannot be resolved locally, prepare a compact escalation package. Include the UTC time window, software version, topology, sanitized configuration, the exact failing operation, and the output gathered when you compare relation sizes, dead tuples, and autovacuum history. Include what changed recently and which proposed causes were ruled out. Do not include passwords, tokens, customer payloads, or an unrestricted diagnostic archive. A good escalation lets another engineer test the same hypothesis without repeating discovery from the beginning.

### Operational safety notes

Avoid destructive cleanup, broad permission changes, unbounded retries, and emergency capacity changes without a rollback point. When the recommended action is to tune autovacuum and rebuild the affected index with a low-lock strategy, stage it on one instance or a controlled environment when possible. Measure the relevant success signal before and after the change. If production impact requires immediate mitigation, separate the temporary mitigation from the permanent correction and create a follow-up item with an owner and deadline.

### Prevention

Add an alert for the earliest measurable precursor, document the capacity or configuration boundary, and create a regression test when the failure can be reproduced safely. The durable lesson for KB-POSTGRESQL-005 is to connect a precise symptom to evidence before changing production state.

## Long-running query blocks migration

Evidence ID: KB-POSTGRESQL-006

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that an ALTER TABLE waits indefinitely. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, another transaction holds a conflicting lock, often from an old query or idle transaction. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, query pg_locks with pg_stat_activity and identify the blocker chain. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to cancel or terminate the blocker safely and schedule lock-sensitive migrations. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring another transaction holds a conflicting lock, often from an old query or idle transaction to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## Replica lag grows

Evidence ID: KB-POSTGRESQL-007

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that standby replay falls minutes behind the primary. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, write volume, network throughput, storage latency, or a replay conflict exceeds standby capacity. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare sent, write, flush, and replay LSNs plus system metrics. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to remove the bottleneck, tune WAL retention, and reduce conflicting standby workloads. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

## Disk fills with WAL

Evidence ID: KB-POSTGRESQL-008

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that pg_wal grows until storage alarms fire. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, an inactive replication slot or failed archive command prevents WAL recycling. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect pg_replication_slots and pg_stat_archiver. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to repair archiving or remove confirmed-unused slots before reclaiming capacity. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.
