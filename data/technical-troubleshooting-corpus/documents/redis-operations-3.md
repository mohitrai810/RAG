# Redis Operations Runbook - Volume 3

This original training corpus contains operational troubleshooting procedures for redis. It is designed for retrieval evaluation, not as a substitute for vendor documentation or a production change-management process.

## Hot key saturates one shard

Evidence ID: KB-REDIS-009

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that one Redis shard has much higher CPU and network traffic than peers. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, a small number of popular keys concentrate requests on a single hash slot. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, sample command traffic and compare per-key access frequency and shard utilization. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to cache locally where safe, split the hot value, or replicate the read path. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring a small number of popular keys concentrate requests on a single hash slot to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it. Check whether the same symptom occurs where the suspected condition is absent, and whether the condition exists on healthy instances. If those comparisons disagree with the hypothesis, return to evidence collection. In particular, do not confuse correlation after a deployment with causation. The decisive observation for KB-REDIS-009 should connect the reported behavior - one Redis shard has much higher CPU and network traffic than peers - to the specific diagnostic signals listed above.

### Evidence package for escalation

If the incident cannot be resolved locally, prepare a compact escalation package. Include the UTC time window, software version, topology, sanitized configuration, the exact failing operation, and the output gathered when you sample command traffic and compare per-key access frequency and shard utilization. Include what changed recently and which proposed causes were ruled out. Do not include passwords, tokens, customer payloads, or an unrestricted diagnostic archive. A good escalation lets another engineer test the same hypothesis without repeating discovery from the beginning.

### Operational safety notes

Avoid destructive cleanup, broad permission changes, unbounded retries, and emergency capacity changes without a rollback point. When the recommended action is to cache locally where safe, split the hot value, or replicate the read path, stage it on one instance or a controlled environment when possible. Measure the relevant success signal before and after the change. If production impact requires immediate mitigation, separate the temporary mitigation from the permanent correction and create a follow-up item with an owner and deadline.

### Prevention

Add an alert for the earliest measurable precursor, document the capacity or configuration boundary, and create a regression test when the failure can be reproduced safely. The durable lesson for KB-REDIS-009 is to connect a precise symptom to evidence before changing production state.

## Expired keys remain visible in memory

Evidence ID: KB-REDIS-010

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that memory falls slowly after a large TTL batch should have expired. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, Redis expiration is partly lazy and active expiry cannot immediately reclaim a synchronized expiration wave. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare expired_keys, key counts, CPU, and TTL distribution. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to jitter TTL values and avoid creating millions of keys with identical expiration times. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring Redis expiration is partly lazy and active expiry cannot immediately reclaim a synchronized expiration wave to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## Connection reset during failover

Evidence ID: KB-REDIS-011

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that clients see transient connection resets when the primary changes. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, clients keep stale primary connections and lack topology-aware retry behavior. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare failover timestamps with client errors and Sentinel or cluster events. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to use bounded retries with jitter and a topology-aware client. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

## Lua script causes server stalls

Evidence ID: KB-REDIS-012

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that all commands pause when a rate-limiter script executes. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, Redis runs Lua atomically on the main thread and the script performs excessive work. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, inspect SLOWLOG and script input sizes. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to make scripts constant-time, cap collection scans, and move bulk work outside Redis. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.
