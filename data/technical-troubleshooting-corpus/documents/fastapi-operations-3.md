# FastAPI Production Runbook - Volume 3

This original training corpus contains operational troubleshooting procedures for fastapi. It is designed for retrieval evaluation, not as a substitute for vendor documentation or a production change-management process.

## Duplicate background execution

Evidence ID: KB-FASTAPI-009

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that a background task runs more than once after retries. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the request is retried without an idempotency boundary. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, trace request IDs and task creation records. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to persist an idempotency key and make task creation atomic. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring the request is retried without an idempotency boundary to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it. Check whether the same symptom occurs where the suspected condition is absent, and whether the condition exists on healthy instances. If those comparisons disagree with the hypothesis, return to evidence collection. In particular, do not confuse correlation after a deployment with causation. The decisive observation for KB-FASTAPI-009 should connect the reported behavior - a background task runs more than once after retries - to the specific diagnostic signals listed above.

### Evidence package for escalation

If the incident cannot be resolved locally, prepare a compact escalation package. Include the UTC time window, software version, topology, sanitized configuration, the exact failing operation, and the output gathered when you trace request IDs and task creation records. Include what changed recently and which proposed causes were ruled out. Do not include passwords, tokens, customer payloads, or an unrestricted diagnostic archive. A good escalation lets another engineer test the same hypothesis without repeating discovery from the beginning.

### Operational safety notes

Avoid destructive cleanup, broad permission changes, unbounded retries, and emergency capacity changes without a rollback point. When the recommended action is to persist an idempotency key and make task creation atomic, stage it on one instance or a controlled environment when possible. Measure the relevant success signal before and after the change. If production impact requires immediate mitigation, separate the temporary mitigation from the permanent correction and create a follow-up item with an owner and deadline.

### Prevention

Add an alert for the earliest measurable precursor, document the capacity or configuration boundary, and create a regression test when the failure can be reproduced safely. The durable lesson for KB-FASTAPI-009 is to connect a precise symptom to evidence before changing production state.

## Response model drops fields

Evidence ID: KB-FASTAPI-010

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that endpoint return data contains fields missing from JSON. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, the declared response_model filters undeclared attributes. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare the return object with the Pydantic response schema. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to add intentional public fields to the schema rather than disabling validation. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring the declared response_model filters undeclared attributes to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## Worker memory duplicated

Evidence ID: KB-FASTAPI-011

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that each process loads a separate embedding model and total RAM multiplies. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, multiple Uvicorn workers independently initialize heavyweight model state. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, compare RSS per worker and model initialization logs. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to choose worker count from memory capacity or use a separate model-serving process. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.

### Counterfactual checks

Before declaring multiple Uvicorn workers independently initialize heavyweight model state to be confirmed, attempt to disprove it.

## Timeout mismatch behind proxy

Evidence ID: KB-FASTAPI-012

### Incident signature

The primary signal is that the proxy returns 504 while the application eventually completes. Treat the first report as a symptom, not as proof of the underlying cause. Capture timestamps, affected instances, recent deployments, and whether the behavior is continuous or intermittent before making changes.

### Most likely cause

In this scenario, proxy, server, and client timeouts are inconsistent with endpoint duration. Similar-looking incidents can have different causes, so do not apply the resolution until the diagnostic observations agree with this explanation.

### Diagnostic procedure

First, correlate proxy access logs and application completion times. Preserve the original error and collect measurements from the same time window. Compare one affected instance with a healthy instance when possible. Avoid restarting immediately because a restart can destroy the state needed to distinguish configuration, capacity, and application defects.

### Resolution

The preferred corrective action is to make the operation asynchronous or align bounded timeouts with the service objective. Apply the smallest reversible change first, verify the original symptom disappears, and then confirm normal behavior under representative load. Record the command, owner, timestamp, and observed result.

### Verification and rollback

Verification requires both recovery and stability. Repeat the failing operation, watch the relevant service and host metrics, and confirm that no neighboring error rate increases. If the change produces a regression, revert it using the recorded previous configuration rather than stacking additional speculative changes.
